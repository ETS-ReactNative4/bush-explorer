# The Migthy Bush App

We all love the nature and beauty of Aotearoa. One of the best pasttimes that we can do in our country is to explore the native flora and fauna via bushwalks! Our app will allow you to get the best out of Aotearoas bush walks by saving your favourite trails, discovering new ones and levelling up your walking with our in-built progression system. We present to you, "The mighty bush!"

Proudly built in one week while at EDA by: Clementine, Finn, Tiaan, Jesse and Tai.

## Note on the app

This application is meant to be downloaded and to function as an iOS or Android mobile application. However, at this stage the entire app is built with React and made to 'simulate' a mobile application. That took some creative thinking. In future the app might be converted and written in React Native. In any case, for some us in this group, the intent is to learn React Native and attempt building a mobile app.
